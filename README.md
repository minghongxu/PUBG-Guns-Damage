# PUBG-Guns-Damage
PlayerUnknownâ€™s Battlegrounds (PUBG) is a popular game develped by company Bluehole. It is an online multiplayer shooting game. 100 players would be sent to an isolated island. They need to compete with each other and kill others. Only the last survivor team could win.
  
I like this game very much, and I developed this program which can calculate damages of various guns for different armors. There is a simple and understandable User Interface. You can pick the gun and armor easily. 

This small application is based on the version of PC 1.0 Update #19. Finished at summer 2018.
